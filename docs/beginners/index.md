## What is Ethereum Classic?

Ethereum Classic (ETC) is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality.

## Why Ethereum Classic?

A blockchain is simply a timestamp server that stores data in blocks. The first application to utilize blockchain technology is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a non-turing complete blockchain which means its capabilities are limited to check and balances of users. However, to have a more complex system requires a different decentralized network of computers. Adding such functionality to Bitcoin was attempted, but not feasable, which lead to the creation of Ethereum Classic.

With the ability to deploy smart contract (scripting) functionality on the blockchain allows users to utilize the ETC network for decentralized applications.

## √êApps - Decentralized Applications

A DApp is backend code running on a decentralized P2P network and can be interfaced with like any other application by making calls to the backend DApp.
