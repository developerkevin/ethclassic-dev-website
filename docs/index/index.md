## Smart Contract Languages

Any program that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is commonly referred to as a “smart contract”. The most popular languages for writing smart contracts on Ethereum are **Solidity** and **Vyper**, though there are [others under development](https://github.com/ConsenSys/ethereum-developer-tools-list#smart-contract-languages).

### Solidity *The most popular language on Ethereum, inspired by C++, Python and Javascript*
- [Documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io)
- [Github](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/)
- [Solidity Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity/)

### Vyper *Security focused language for Ethereum, based on Python.*
- [Documentation](https://vyper.readthedocs.io)
- [Github](https://github.com/ethereum/vyper)
- [Vyper Gitter Chatroom](https://gitter.im/ethereum/vyper)

## Public RPC End-points

### Main-net

- [ethereumclassic.network](https://ethereumclassic.network/) *Provided by ECC*

### Test-net

- [kotti.ethereumclassic.network](https://kotti.ethereumclassic.network) *Provided by Ethernode*
  
## Standards and Specifications

- [OpenRPC](https://open-rpc.org/) *Provided by ECLC*

The OpenRPC Specification defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for JSON-RPC 2.0 APIs.

- [Pristine](https://open-rpc.org/) *Provided by ECLC*

Pristine is a starting point, it follows a Documentation Driven Development approach, and can be used as a resource to augment existing documentation.
